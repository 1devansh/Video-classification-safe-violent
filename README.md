# Video Analysis to Detect Suspicious Activity Based on Deep Learning
### Using Deep Learing techniques to classify a video into three classes: criminal or violent activity, potentially suspicious, or safe.
### Folder heirarchy
Put all your videos according to their classes in different folders and all those folders under one folder named "data".
Extracted frames will go under predictedDatasetImages folder with train, test and validation as different sub folders.
predicted folder contains result video after prediction in .avi format and .mp4 format
### Video Name
Please ensure that your dataset consists of videos which are named as "A_1.mp4" where A representes the class and 1 represents the class. The extracted images will be named as "A_1-0.jpg" which implies this is the first frame from the first video in class A.
